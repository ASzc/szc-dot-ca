## About

These are the source files for my personal website at https://szc.ca

## Requirements

The scripts are written for Bash and depend on the usual GNU coreutils, findutils, etc. Additionally:

*   deploy.sh uses rsync and pandoc
*   woff.sh uses sfnt2woff
*   devserver.sh calls Python 3's http.server
